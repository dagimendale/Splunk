## Splunk Defense Project

I used Splunk to design a custom monitoring environment to protect a fictional organization. I created custom reports, alerts, dashboards, and add-on apps to protect our mock company. Then I experienced a simulated attack and analyzed the results to determine the effectiveness of my monitoring solutions. I completed the project by showcasing my defensive solution in a class presentation.
