# Splunk Defense Project

## Project Overview

In this project, I utilized **Splunk** to design a custom monitoring environment to protect a fictional organization. The project involved creating custom configurations, including reports, alerts, dashboards, and add-on apps to defend a mock company against cybersecurity threats. After implementing the monitoring solutions, I simulated a cyberattack to evaluate the effectiveness of my defense system. The final outcome was showcased in a class presentation where I demonstrated how well the defensive solutions performed.

### Key Features:
- **Custom Reports**: Designed to monitor and analyze suspicious network traffic, failed login attempts, and potential security breaches.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Created to trigger notifications for unusual activity and potential security incidents.
- **Dashboards**: Developed to visualize key security metrics, providing insights into the health and security of the monitored systems.
- **Add-On Apps**: Utilized custom apps to extend Splunkâ€™s functionality and improve monitoring capabilities.

### Simulated Attack:
- A simulated cyberattack was executed to test the efficacy of the monitoring solutions. The results were analyzed to identify potential gaps and improve the defensive strategies.

### Tools & Technologies:
- **Splunk**: Used for event management, log analysis, and monitoring.
- **Simulated Attack**: Various penetration testing tools were used to create an attack scenario, including **SQL injection** and **cross-site scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities.
- **Data**: Sample security logs were used to simulate a real-world environment.
